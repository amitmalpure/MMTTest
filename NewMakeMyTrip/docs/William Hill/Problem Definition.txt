Problem statement: 
	Write an automated browser-based test on William Hill site, an online racing and sports betting website.
	URL: https://www.williamhill.com.au/
	Scenario: Add a Horse racing bet to the Bet slip and add some stake.
	
Pending tasks:
	Due to lack of time, I couldn't write negative test cases and result logs. 
	But given enough time, I can provide code for that as well.
